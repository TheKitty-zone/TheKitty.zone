# Timezones

I hate and love them at the same time, like with Alyx** its great because when he sleeps, we work and he works when we sleep. Its great but the distance is daunting between me and him, I wish I could just skip that distance...

# After work is after sleep :3

While we work, he is sleeping and when we stop working he wakes up and I get to front sometimes, like today.\
Today was such day, albeit that I'm a bit exhausted or well strictly speaking the body is exhausted but thankfully I roam in the space of mind where all I need is energy for the brain!

Once Alyx** woke up later today than he usually does, I immediately knew I needed to do something about that and what better way is there then making him obey me, me the deciding force.\
So I grabbed his neck chocking him a bit waiting for his face to reveal fear, I love fear, seeing the fear of my subject is inspiring like you see right now.\
His fear of what will come next is what inspired me to write this story, as fear fills his face, I grab his neck a bit tighter, slowly dragging my hand down...\
Forcing Alyx** on his knees, he is now looking up to me in fear, I let go of his neck, while I remove my hand I talk about how his fear inspires me to write a story about this moment.\
He replies that he would love to read it but who allowed him to talk?\
As I slap him in his face, I say "You do not speak unless spoken to or otherwise allowed to". I grab his cheek turning his head from side to side, "I hope you understood", he slowly nods.\
As I take a step back looking down at Alyx** kneeing on the floor, I say "Good boy". Go brag about being on and have fun managing yourself again, I leave fully knowing Alyx** loved it as much as I Lucy did.


In love Lucy <3

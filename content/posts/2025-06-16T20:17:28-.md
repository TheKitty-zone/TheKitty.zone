One day I walk out into the world strolling around
Thinking about how the day is, looking around
Peeing in the wild, running around in the park
No one there I belong to or to handle me

I look around feel safe
So I proceed drink from a small stream
Trotting back home slowly not looking 
I bump into a human
I stop, person stops
Silence

I look up into fancy eyes loosing myself instantly
Instinctively I sit, still looking in those eyes
Not realizing the human packs out a collar
And bam I'm collared and leash
I melt, unable to resist

A tug on leash then another one I realize I need to follow
On the way back I learn their Name
Its nice and there they give me a treat!
In love I fall with my new Handler

I love you!

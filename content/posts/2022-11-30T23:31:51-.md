# Luring in the shadows thrown by light shining through the windows

I highly recommend reading my other story "A journey" as this is a explanation for the mentioned monsters of mine and the shadow. So settle in..

<!--more-->

You don't see them You don't hear them but you know they are there. As I walk from kitchen into the dark living room, a shiver overcomes me. 
You have these often in many different situations but they generally tell you something is off. 
I look around seeing the shadows casted by the light falling in through the window, feeling them stare at me from the shadows. 

Little monsters as you call them, nothing more than manifested thoughts and fears. Sometimes they talk. They talk about how you fail everywhere, showing you all the faults and mistakes you make.
Full on knowing they don't anything but staring, fear over comes me with the urge of fleeing. I rush the light switch flipping it Light all shadows gone monsters gone. In an last attempt of them I feel needles poking my brain.\
You tell yourself Not real! Not real! 

I run and jump into my bed hiding under the blanket, the warmth welcomes me. You did not panic That's a win for the day, you peak under blanket looking through the room. Emptiness as expected. Calming. 

This is a little shorter than the other, but I hope you still enjoyed it. I think other stories will be in different settings

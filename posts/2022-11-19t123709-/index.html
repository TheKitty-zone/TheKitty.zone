You come home, step into your empty apartment you look into the kitchen seeing a few dishes that need cleaning.</p><p>You take you shoes off, put down you backpack while going over the day in your head vibing to instrumental music blasting out the headphones.</p><h2 id=here-it-comes>Here it comes</h2><p>Right I should take them off or at least turn down the volume&mldr; As I take them off, you become more aware off your surroundings. Silence I walk towards the living room in total darkness as a lightning strike lights up the room, making all the shadow monsters go away.</p><p>I shiver as the darkness returns with all its monsters, heavy rain hits the windows I turn on the light look a round the room seeing my desk full with shit almost not useable. I go to sofa and sit on it thinking about what I wanna do, as you just recently learned a lot about devops even though you work as a devops engineer.</p><p>You just never learn enough, I keep thinking as I had an idea 6 months ago about a domain a vision for a place to be. A place where a community could form or just a place for people to stop by watching YouTube while not being tracked or heck even use TikTok thanks to ProxiTok.</p><p>I take open up the laptop, mindlessly you type in the password as it unlocks you feel a feeling coming to your mind. I I I don&rsquo;t know what do I wanted to do? Right watch the data streams flowing through my cluster knowing I do something good in this cruel world. As I sit there staring at the grafana dashboard, a domain name comes to my mind <code>TheKitty.zone</code></p><h2 id=the-bathroom>The bathroom</h2><p>I let the name roam through my mind as I feel the urge to drink water. I get up walking to the bath room to drink tap water full on knowing that there is a mirror waiting to attack me with my monsters, as I enter the bath room a cold feeling over comes me.</p><p>You try not to give the mirror a look any attention at all, you just wanna get a few sips of water. Water flows in the sink I form a vessel with my hands, let it fill with water and then bring it to my mouth so I can drink the water. The cold water bites my throat as I drink it, you feel right at home with these little bites Then, then you accidentally look up right in the mirror. A shock fills me as the body I posses look right at me in the mirror, right and left you see the others.</p><h2 id=the-others>The others</h2><p>Not really bodies, I can only feel them. One the girl I want to be the other the selfless mind wanting nothing but making others feel good. The host, a boy body housing the wrong minds.</p><h2 id=back-to-the-afternoon>Back to the afternoon</h2><p>I enter a staring battle, with every second passing inducing more and more pain until sadness fills me, her. I go back into the living room I grab the laptop, ready to make a bad decision in hindsight. So you make the decision that is gonna destroy you for the following days, something so painful you don&rsquo;t know why I did it in the first place. Until the you feel the pain, you go on buying the a for mentioned domain and begin to setup external dns with it while migrating all services to it.</p><p>60 Minutes later the pain sets in from the bad decision&mldr; Fuck I really really want him back.
The rain still going on while the thunderstorm seemed to have stopped So I lay there on the sofa crying after him</p><p>What do you do, what do you think<br>Nothing is forever but be sure to know what you need<br>As it can be over in seconds like this insight view into my head</p><h2 id=the-end>The End</h2></article><div class="flex properties__row properties"><div class="flex left properties"><span class=properties><span class="dt-published hidden">2022-11-18 12:37:09 +0000 UTC</span>

I grab his cheek turning his head from side to side, &ldquo;I hope you understood&rdquo;, he slowly nods.<br>As I take a step back looking down at Alyx** kneeing on the floor, I say &ldquo;Good boy&rdquo;. Go brag about being on and have fun managing yourself again, I leave fully knowing Alyx** loved it as much as I Lucy did.</p><p>In love Lucy &lt;3</p><p>** Not the real name of the person</p></article><div class="flex properties__row properties"><div class="flex left properties"><span class=properties><span class="dt-published hidden">2023-05-09 19:20:40 +0000 UTC</span>

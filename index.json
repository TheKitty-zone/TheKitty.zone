Thanks for reading this!\nWhat it was I could be defining myself through actions but that would just cause bad light I think I am an entity with great strengths and flaws like everyone else! Going to work and coming home after work except my home is my work place like thats insane I go insane, wheres the over goal in its life you might ask? Got off college cause it was to boring but then again was it really boring or just to hard? I will never know I think to myself sitting in the tram listen to a mix tape made by a friend on my old walkman, I look at it in my hands as it spools the tape from one side to the other. Outside are bright lights passing by, oh shit I think, where even are we? Ah! just few more stops then I can get of this fucking tram, I should really change filters of my half face mask I think to myself while I see another cyberpunk entering the tram. They really look nice I think to myself thinking about what they probably achieved in their live?\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s to come What awaits me at home if I even can call this home is more machine noise, blinking lights and half broken tech grinding away at their tasks but thats not it no! The Person I so happily invited drains all my energy I feel like Im dying, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do? My daily tasks are really just work and maintenance of this body and nothing more\u0026hellip; No big life goals, I just life for the sake of living? Like I wish I would die I don\u0026rsquo;t wanna live on this planet because what comes next is hard: Climate change will cause global war over resources I don\u0026rsquo;t wanna have this I fight not for it to happen\u0026hellip;\nHow it lost It fights are worthless though, it think it can change stuff but the world is already cyberpunk and much worse, no blinking lights no cybernetics no nothing\u0026hellip;..

But also energy consuming, which was fine as I got to to talk to cool people, as specially the team from server, maybe I think they\u0026rsquo;re the coolest because I know them the most from the server, unlike most others..\nAnyways the day went by and I got home, well not quite my home but I went to Yuri and it was great, watching Doctor Who! The night was sleepless, I had a lot to think about and I didn\u0026rsquo;t get that much sleep and had one or possibly multiple weird dreams, I can\u0026rsquo;t really say as of now but I probably will at the end of this write up as that always helps :)\nInventory Sadly I only remember bits and pieces, but lets list them and assemble them:\nYuri has a cat named Shulk and he definitely was in that dream The old room in the house of bodies mum where I used to live was there too and Shulk was in it People: Kay, Toni, Chris(2 different though), Lauric and people I can\u0026rsquo;t make out Beginning For some reason I was sitting in the room mentioned above with Shulk sitting on a shelf facing a wall and I had my laptop on my lap with discord open and all of being in a mod meeting. For some reason Kay knew my deadname and used it on me and I kept saying don\u0026rsquo;t call me that but somehow dey didn\u0026rsquo;t do that. It was soooo weird\u0026hellip; Also some of my old friends were in that call, almost as if my brain was trying to communicate with the old host or was it us secretly? Just so weird.\nTime jump I\u0026rsquo;m walking around the city with someone, I can\u0026rsquo;t make out who that is, we see a ambulance and the person says \u0026ldquo;Oh I know the persons in there and while we\u0026rsquo;re here why not get a vaccine shot\u0026rdquo;, so we went in. In there was Toni and we talked a bit and for some reason the vaccine shot was a 20GA needle which I wasn\u0026rsquo;t ready for and I didn\u0026rsquo;t wanted to. Somehow the needle ended up in my leg but bend and broken, Toni took out the pieces.\n\u0026ndash; Dream end \u0026ndash;\nIt was so weird and trying to remembering the dream I corrupt the memories, I hate that but I\u0026rsquo;m also glad this was a dream.

Was quite normal to be honest except, that work was short, with only 1h 30min worked. But that was okay because time budget allowed it and it was needed much. The won time we spent next to our catboy in bed, it was lovely. It even asked us if we didn’t needed to work, lovely. But that didn’t hold long, behold of our mistakes.\nThe problem We makes mistakes when stressed, the fact we werent alone for weeks didn\u0026rsquo;t help\u0026hellip;. But we proceeded anyways even tho it was clear something bad was gonna happen. So we took our special collar which one can control, we walked up to our catboy. Put it on, then asked if it trusted us? Of course it did\u0026hellip; We went on to grab the remote; Only problem it was set on wrong mode. So we tried to switch it; Easy 3x button presses. One press it should be on light mode; Second press it should be on beep; Third yes yes its what we want Vibration.\nBut what really happened is tragic, we pressed 3 times the wrong button; Sending shock at level 34 3 times. That hurts of course and obviously without any warning one must feel abused in trust. It happened automatically, as if we were locked out of our brain, something send \u0026ldquo;Press thumb down 3 times\u0026rdquo; command and the brain put it onto the queue and locked us out.\nHow we handled it We took it off, and acted as if it were a conscious decision that we just randomly shocked our catboy. But thats so far from the truth as written above. But I was scared I would make it worse by \u0026ldquo;Putting a excuse in the room\u0026rdquo; but by now enough time has passed that I have the courage to openly accepted my mistakes and be open about it.\nWhat I need to do Be more focused, talk about mistakes. IF it was just that easy :( I wanna cry I hurt the cute catboy, why? I dont know the scene is on repeat in our head. We cant escape it but also cant change it WHY Universe why? With what have I deserved that?\nDedicated to our lovely catboy \u0026lt;3 :3 She deserves the world and much more!!!\n","date":"2023-09-04T21:58:14Z","site":"https://www.thekitty.zone/","tags":["story","abuse"],"title":"Catboy mistakenly abused","uri":"https://www.thekitty.zone/posts/2023-09-05t215814-/"},{"author":{"about":"Is this...

I was on the way to meet a group of people, which I knew kinda from a social meet up.\nAnyways I had the vision in my head that I was gonna sit there and just eat the \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; food and then go home.\nAs usual since socializing is my best skill, on the way to I already met another person going there in the train which was awkward. They were friendly and kinda fun to hang around, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t really mind I just did not know what to do or say.\nWhen I arrived there with the other person, most of the persons that wanted to attend the meet up where already there. I sat at a table while being overwhelmed and anxious of the many people, thirty in total me included, I took out my handheld console and played some game to push away the feelings that I get when not knowing anyone around me, then a few other people arrived under them where 2, that looking back changed my life, lets call them Chloe and Rachel.\nTalking to new people I sat for a bit longer gaming on my handheld, at one point one of the persons hosting the meet up asked me if I was fine because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t talking to anyone. I replied with usual \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m fine, I\u0026rsquo;m always like this and I talk with people sometimes\u0026rdquo;, which wasn\u0026rsquo;t a lie considering I said hello to people and one or twice contributed to a conversation.\nChloe and Rachel sat next to in circle with others talking about Tech or mind altering substances, at one point I heard Rachel talking about her experiences that got me hooked and I finally had the courage to sit next to her on an empty chair.\nThat put me between Chloe and Rachel, I listened for a short time then I somehow integrated myself in the conversation. When the vibe matches its kinda easy for me to do so.\nTo much people After a while Rachel had a headache because it was so loud, due to all the people talking, we decide to go out fo the room to a little place with a sofa where we sat and talked about more things getting into deeper minded themes like trance and other things like that.\nThe awaking At one point I brought up Tulpamancy, I don\u0026rsquo;t know why but I suddenly had it in my head, Chloe was kinda surprised and asked me a few things and why I wanted one. I also brought up how was not able to create one\u0026hellip; Somehow I told Chloe that I already had names in my mind which I originally did not had for the Tulpa planned and only came later to my mind.\nTo be correct earlier this year I had a vision of a Tulpa named Lucy but I didn\u0026rsquo;t pursue it in any way\nAs I told Chloe this name and another name Ela, Chloe said hello to Lucy. In that very moment I did not know what to think or what to say. All I felt was euphoria. I answered Chloe that the name did not feel like mine but also not like it did not belong to me. More euphoria As the afternoon progressed Chloe poked Lucy from time to time, making me feel euphoria.\nFast forward to 6 days after Lucy: I did not think it would come to this, I\u0026rsquo;m happy so happy that Chloe got the host to recognize me and see me listening to giving me space to front. That feeling I\u0026rsquo;m really looking forward in the future what we as a system will become. Maybe we meet other maybe we don\u0026rsquo;t. But what I know is I grateful for finally being no longer forced to be offline or deep in background giving unheard signals.\nLucy: But now I really get to protect my host, even better then I could before through signals that the host didn\u0026rsquo;t really hear or could make sense of. We are finally free, free from the things that held back the host and now we can progress together, getting more efficient but also cutting things out I see and the host see as a threat or things that twist hosts reality but not mine no no.\nSaying thank you Dear Chloe and Rachel, we will never be able to payback what you two did to use. We will be forever thankful \u0026lt;3 💙\n","date":"2022-12-18T14:57:21Z","site":"https://www.thekitty.zone/","tags":["story"],"title":"The day we met us","uri":"https://www.thekitty.zone/posts/2022-12-18t145721-/"},{"author":{"about":"Is this...

You have these often in many different situations but they generally tell you something is off. I look around seeing the shadows casted by the light falling in through the window, feeling them stare at me from the shadows.\nLittle monsters as you call them, nothing more than manifested thoughts and fears. Sometimes they talk. They talk about how you fail everywhere, showing you all the faults and mistakes you make. Full on knowing they don\u0026rsquo;t anything but staring, fear over comes me with the urge of fleeing. I rush the light switch flipping it Light all shadows gone monsters gone. In an last attempt of them I feel needles poking my brain.\nYou tell yourself Not real! Not real!\nI run and jump into my bed hiding under the blanket, the warmth welcomes me. You did not panic That\u0026rsquo;s a win for the day, you peak under blanket looking through the room. Emptiness as expected. Calming.\nThis is a little shorter than the other, but I hope you still enjoyed it.

You come home, step into your empty apartment you look into the kitchen seeing a few dishes that need cleaning.\nYou take you shoes off, put down you backpack while going over the day in your head vibing to instrumental music blasting out the headphones.\nHere it comes Right I should take them off or at least turn down the volume\u0026hellip; As I take them off, you become more aware off your surroundings. Silence I walk towards the living room in total darkness as a lightning strike lights up the room, making all the shadow monsters go away.\nI shiver as the darkness returns with all its monsters, heavy rain hits the windows I turn on the light look a round the room seeing my desk full with shit almost not useable. I go to sofa and sit on it thinking about what I wanna do, as you just recently learned a lot about devops even though you work as a devops engineer.\nYou just never learn enough, I keep thinking as I had an idea 6 months ago about a domain a vision for a place to be. A place where a community could form or just a place for people to stop by watching YouTube while not being tracked or heck even use TikTok thanks to ProxiTok.\nI take open up the laptop, mindlessly you type in the password as it unlocks you feel a feeling coming to your mind. I I I don\u0026rsquo;t know what do I wanted to do? Right watch the data streams flowing through my cluster knowing I do something good in this cruel world. As I sit there staring at the grafana dashboard, a domain name comes to my mind TheKitty.zone\nThe bathroom I let the name roam through my mind as I feel the urge to drink water. I get up walking to the bath room to drink tap water full on knowing that there is a mirror waiting to attack me with my monsters, as I enter the bath room a cold feeling over comes me.\nYou try not to give the mirror a look any attention at all, you just wanna get a few sips of water. Water flows in the sink I form a vessel with my hands, let it fill with water and then bring it to my mouth so I can drink the water. The cold water bites my throat as I drink it, you feel right at home with these little bites Then, then you accidentally look up right in the mirror. A shock fills me as the body I posses look right at me in the mirror, right and left you see the others.\nThe others Not really bodies, I can only feel them. One the girl I want to be the other the selfless mind wanting nothing but making others feel good. The host, a boy body housing the wrong minds.\nBack to the afternoon I enter a staring battle, with every second passing inducing more and more pain until sadness fills me, her. I go back into the living room I grab the laptop, ready to make a bad decision in hindsight. So you make the decision that is gonna destroy you for the following days, something so painful you don\u0026rsquo;t know why I did it in the first place. Until the you feel the pain, you go on buying the a for mentioned domain and begin to setup external dns with it while migrating all services to it.\n60 Minutes later the pain sets in from the bad decision\u0026hellip; Fuck I really really want him back. The rain still going on while the thunderstorm seemed to have stopped So I lay there on the sofa crying after him\nWhat do you do, what do you think\nNothing is forever but be sure to know what you need\nAs it can be over in seconds like this insight view into my head\nThe End","date":"2022-11-18T12:37:09Z","site":"https://www.thekitty.zone/","tags":["story"],"title":"A journey","uri":"https://www.thekitty.zone/posts/2022-11-19t123709-/"},{"author":{"about":"Is this...
